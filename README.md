# Deck of Cards

This simple demo is created to practice with React Lifecycle.

## Deck of Cards

▶ When you click the button you get one random card from the API https://deckofcardsapi.com/ with the help of axios and using async await.

▶ When you get the card you also get the id of the deck in order to get the rest of the cards of the same deck. 

▶ As you get cards, they will be placed randomly on top of each other.

▶ When there are no more cards left, you will get a warning message.
